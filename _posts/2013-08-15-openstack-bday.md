title: OpenStack's 3rd Birthday
---

Recently the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) project celebrated it's [3rd birthday](http://www.openstack.org/birthday). 

The OpenStack Foundation was kind enough to provide #canstack with some funds to celebrate with, so we rallied everyone we could find and who was free to come down to Edmonton's [Sugarbowl](http://www.thesugarbowl.org/) and have a bit of food and drink and perhaps discuss OpenStack's success.

There is a [slideshow](http://www.slideshare.net/openstack/openstack-3rd-birthday) that has pictures from all of the birthday parties around the world (see slide 54/55 for the Edmonton pictures, and 57-59 for the [Toronto OpenStack Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStackTO/) party)

So, thanks to the OpenStack Foundation, and I look forward to using future versions of OpenStack.
