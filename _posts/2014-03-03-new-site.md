Recently I moved the #canstack website from a virtual machine to being hosted on Github pages, and in doing so also moved to a bootstrap based format, albeit an extremely plain one. I'm also transitioning the blog posts onto the Github page as well in hopes that it will make it easier for others to contribute to the site simply by sending a pull request.

Also I added a [users](http://canstack.ca/users) page with a few organizations that are using OpenStack in Canada, though I am sure there are many, many more. If you are reading this blog post and know of an organization that is using OpenStack in Canada, please do let me know.

### March 2014 Meeting

**UPDATE 2:** I've setup a Google Hangout that can be found at this link: [http://tinyurl.com/canstackmarch2014](http://tinyurl.com/canstackmarch2014). I haven't used Google Hangouts to organize meetings like this, so hopefully things go all right, please bear with me. 

**UPDATE 1:** *Meetup.com is back in business! Please see the [March meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/Canadian-OpenStack-Users-Group/events/169186662/) for more information. The meetup will occur on March 20th, 12PM Mountain Standard Time. Remote voice and video information to follow on the event page on meetup.com.*

I'm in the process of setting up a #canstack meeting in March of 2014. Unfortunately, as I write this, meetup.com is under a DOS attack and is not functioning. But once meetup.com is back up again I will work on getting a time and place setup. 

As usual, any comments, questions, or criticisms pleaset let me know by either tweeting to [@canstack](https://twitter.com/canstack) or by emailing curtis@serverascode.com.
