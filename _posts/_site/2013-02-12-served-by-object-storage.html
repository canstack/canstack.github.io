<h1>This blog is served via object storage</h1>
<p>One of the things I would like to do with CanStack is try to at least serve the website and blog via &#8220;cloud&#8221; technologies. Currently the main website is running out of a Canadian OpenStack cloud. And now, this blog is being served by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> which is an object storage system that can serve static files such as websites.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly easy to setup this site on S3, so if there are people out there who are unsure as how to use object storage, I encourage you to take another look. The <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync">s3cmd makes syncing directories</a> pretty easy. Hosting a website is not the best application of object storage, but it&#8217;s one that most people can wrap their heads around, and provides a good entry into using the technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not aware of any Canadian object storage providers that can also provide the functionality of serving static websites via http. If anyone knows of any, please let me know and I would be happy to move this blog to their service.</p>
<p>Over the next while I&#8217;ll be writing some blog posts about OpenStack and other cloud-related issues, as well as improving the look of the blog, so check back every once and a while. You can also follow CanStack on <a href="http://twitter.com/canstack">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
